# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of anonymized Uber ride data, 
Weather.csv, Cab ride.csv
including information such as timestamps, trip durations, pickup and drop-off locations, and other relevant attributes. 
The dataset is sufficiently large and diverse to ensure robust findings and meaningful conclusions.

# Analysis Objectives
The primary objectives of this data analysis project are as follows:

Demand Patterns: Explore the temporal patterns of ride demand to identify peak hours,
weekdays with high demand, and seasonal variations. 
This analysis will help in optimizing resource allocation and improving operational efficiency.

Geographic Analysis: Analyze the geographic distribution of trips to identify popular pickup and drop-off locations,
as well as areas with high demand. This information can be used to optimize driver allocation and strategically position vehicles.

Trip Duration and Distance: Investigate the relationship between trip duration,
distance traveled, and other variables to gain insights into factors affecting ride duration. 
This analysis can aid in estimating travel times accurately and optimizing route planning.

User Segmentation: Segment users based on their usage patterns, such as frequency of rides,preferred time slots, and trip distances. 
This segmentation analysis will enable targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
